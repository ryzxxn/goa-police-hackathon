##Project Title
##Overview
##This project consists of a backend built with Flask and a frontend built with a JavaScript framework (e.g., React). Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

##Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Node.js and npm
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Setup Instructions
Backend Setup
Navigate to the Backend Directory

Open your terminal and change to the /backend directory:


cd backend
Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies:


python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

##On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

##On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Python Dependencies

##Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Backend Server

##Start the Flask server:
python app.py  # Adjust the filename as necessary

##Client Setup
Navigate to the Client Directory

Open another terminal window (or tab) and change to the /client directory:


cd client
##Install Client Dependencies
##Install the required Node.js libraries:


npm install
Run the Client Development Server

Start the client server:


npm run dev
##Important Notes
Ensure that ports 5000 (for the backend) and 3000 (for the frontend) are not being used by other applications. You can check which ports are in use and terminate those processes if necessary.

To check if a port is in use, you can use the following commands:

macOS/Linux:


lsof -i :5000
lsof -i :3000
Windows:


netstat -ano | findstr :5000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

##Accessing the Application
Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

##Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that you're using compatible versions of Node.js and Python. Check the console output for any error messages that can guide you in troubleshooting.
